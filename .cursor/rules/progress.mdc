Okay, here's the project progress report reset to the beginning, with all tasks marked as pending [ ] and estimated progress set to 0%.

Project Progress (JavaScript Version - Reset)
Phase 1: Foundation Setup [Status: Not Started] (Estimated 0%)
Objective: Create the skeleton

[ ] Project Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up monorepo with workspaces (client/server/shared)
- [ ] Configure module resolution/paths for cross-package imports (using relative paths, bundler aliases, or Node.js resolution)
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline for testing/builds (linting with ESLint, potential bundling)

[ ] Core Rendering System (Three.js)
- [ ] Initialize Three.js scene with WebGL renderer
- [ ] Create viewport management system (resize handling)
- [ ] Set up basic lighting/shadow system

[ ] Physics Engine Setup (Rapier)
- [ ] Initialize identical Rapier Worlds (client/server)
- [ ] Load shared map physics geometry (client/server)
- [ ] Setup physics simulation loop (world.step())

[ ] Network Foundation (Socket.io) (Critical Path)
- [ ] Establish WebSocket connection protocol (Socket.io)
- [ ] Create message serialization/deserialization layer (e.g., JSON)
- [ ] Implement basic heartbeat/ping system

Phase 2: Player Systems [Status: Not Started] (Estimated 0%)
Objective: Create the core interaction layer

[ ] Avatar System (Three.js & JS Logic)
- [ ] GLB character loader with animation mapping (AnimationMixer)
- [ ] First-person camera rig (arms/weapon view attached to camera)
- [ ] Third-person spectator camera

[ ] Movement Engine (Vanilla JS, Rapier) (Critical Path)
- [ ] WASD keyboard input handler (addEventListener)
- [ ] Mouse look controller (pitch/yaw, Pointer Lock API)
- [ ] Collision detection with map geometry (using Rapier physics)

[ ] Networked State (Socket.io, Rapier, JS Logic)
- [ ] Client prediction/reconciliation system (client steps local Rapier world, server receives inputs)
- [ ] Server-side movement validation (server steps authoritative Rapier world)
- [ ] State snapshot interpolation (Smoothing remote player movement)

Phase 3: Combat Systems [Status: Not Started] (0%)
Objective: Build the actual gameplay mechanics (1v1 Focus)

[ ] Weapon System (Rapier Raycasting, JS Logic)
- [ ] Rapier-based raycast/shape-cast shooting mechanism
- [ ] Bullet spread/recoil patterns (affecting ray or physics forces)
- [ ] Hit registration (client sends intent, server validates via Rapier raycast)

[ ] Damage Model (Server JS Logic, Rapier Hitboxes)
- [ ] Health/armor management system (server-side JS variables)
- [ ] Hitbox configuration (using Rapier colliders) per character
- [ ] Server-side damage calculation (based on validated Rapier hits)

[ ] Match Flow (Server JS Logic, 1v1 Format)
- [ ] Round timer/countdown system (setTimeout/setInterval)
- [ ] Score tracking (kills/deaths/rounds)
- [ ] Victory/defeat conditions (e.g., first to X rounds)

Phase 4: Multiplayer Infrastructure [Status: Not Started] (0%)
Objective: Enable mass concurrent 1v1 matches

[ ] Matchmaking Service (Node.js Logic)
- [ ] Player rating (ELO) system (JS logic)
- [ ] Queue management (JS array or Redis via Node client)
- [ ] Server load balancer integration (Infrastructure level)

[ ] Game Instance Isolation (Node.js)
- [ ] Dedicated Node.js process per match (child_process or worker_threads)
- [ ] Process lifecycle management (JS scripts)
- [ ] Crash recovery system (JS monitoring logic)

[ ] State Persistence (DBs via JS Clients)
- [ ] Redis session storage (Node Redis client)
- [ ] MongoDB match history (Node MongoDB client)
- [ ] Leaderboard aggregation (JS logic or DB query)

Phase 5: Optimization & Scaling [Status: Not Started] (0%)
Objective: Achieve target concurrent matches

[ ] Network Optimization
- [ ] Delta state compression (JS object comparison)
- [ ] Packet prioritization (Socket.io logic)
- [ ] Bandwidth throttling (Server-side controls)

[ ] Spatial Partitioning / Interest Management (Rapier Queries)
- [ ] Map segmentation logic (if needed for large maps)
- [ ] Interest management system (server sends relevant updates only)
- [ ] LOD model switching (Three.js)

[ ] Horizontal Scaling (Infrastructure)
- [ ] Containerization (Docker for Node.js app)
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster configuration
- [ ] Auto-scaling triggers (CPU/connections/memory)
- [ ] Global server region deployment

Phase 6: Security & Anti-Cheat [Status: Not Started] (0%)
Objective: Maintain fair competitive environment

[ ] Client Hardening
- [ ] JavaScript code obfuscation/minification (Build step)
- [ ] (Advanced) Memory tamper detection research
- [ ] Input pattern analysis research

[ ] Server Validation (Authoritative Rapier & JS Logic)
- [ ] Movement plausibility checks (validating against server Rapier simulation)
- [ ] Shot verification rewinding (using server Rapier raycasts & history)
- [ ] Rate limiting per action (JS logic)

[ ] Monitoring
- [ ] Cheat pattern detection analysis (Logging and manual/AI review)
- [ ] Player report system (Simple endpoint and UI)
- [ ] Match replay data storage (Saving inputs/state snapshots)

Phase 7: Polish & Launch [Status: Not Started] (0%)
Objective: Ship production-ready 1v1 experience

[ ] Performance Tuning
- [ ] Client FPS optimization (JS, Three.js, Rapier tuning)
- [ ] Server tick rate calibration (Node.js / Rapier performance)
- [ ] Database indexing/query optimization

[ ] UI/UX Polish (Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS)
